## Hi, I'm Lachie

I'm a Graduating Computer Scientist and Software Dev; with a BSci
from The University of Sydney.

I'm passionate about using my life to do good and honour God, and I'm
fascinated by technology. As a result, I'm wired for using technology
in creative and positive ways. I get excited when I have the chance to
leverage the skills I love using for the good of others.  

I'm hoping to marry these twin passions throughout my career,
making serious and skilfull contributions to work which has an impact for good.

For now, more details can be found at [my github](https://github.com/lachm99).
