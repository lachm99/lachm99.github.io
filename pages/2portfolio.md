### Rationale

This e-portfolio documents my ongoing journey in teaching Stage 6 Mathematics, with a focus on building a learning environment that fosters critical thinking, inclusivity, and effective resource management. The resources and evidence included reflect both my current understanding and my aspirations for growth in the profession. Each artefact and resource has been selected purposefully to highlight my efforts toward my three core learning goals, goals which both align with my philosophy of teaching and focus my attention on key areas for personal growth.  

In aiming to make my classroom a space for true thinking, I draw on research and observations that emphasise conceptual understanding as the foundation of mathematical learning. My Christian faith and focus on wholistic education means I am committed to designing lessons that move beyond technical proficiency, capturing students' curiosity and nurturing their critical thinking skills. I also recognize the importance of differentiation in Stage 6 Mathematics, where students arrive with varied abilities and backgrounds. My goal is to create learning experiences that are accessible and challenging for each student, made in the image of God, fostering an inclusive and supportive environment.

Finally, I have observed the value of a robust collection of resources for long-term success in teaching. A strong bank of quality materials will support me as I transition into a full teaching role, helping me manage time effectively while ensuring lesson quality. Many artefacts in this portfolio represent ideas that have been collected from experts, or resources that will reduce preparation and organisational load.  

Collectively, this eportfolio showcases my dedication to thoughtful, impactful mathematics teaching in Stage 6 which: emphasises the value of learning mathematics in God's world, both for cognitive and affective reasons; invites every student, as an image-bearer, to participate meaningfully; and is sustainable and realistic, recognising my limits and using quality resources to assist my practice.  

### Learning Goals
The objectives of this rationale can be distilled into three specific learning goals which define the shape of this portfolio.  

My first learning goal for Stage 6 Mathematics is to make my classroom a place where students truly think. Taking inspiration from both research and observation, I want my students to be regularly engaged in deep conceptual thinking which captures their curiosity and encourages them to develop thinking skills rather than mere technical proficiency.  

My second learning goal is to improve my practice regarding differentiation. Students all arrive in class with a variety of different ability levels and personal backgrounds. Many students will hold little in common beyond the fact that they selected a Stage 6 Mathematics course. Hence, I want to make my teaching accessible and challenging for each student, not just occasionally, but as a consistent feature of the classroom.  

My final learning goal is to collect and acquire quality resources for planning, preparing, teaching, and assessing. As I enter the profession in earnest next year, I am very aware of my personal limits in terms of both energy and time. I know that in order to flourish, I will need a strong bank of resources from which to draw, reducing the burden of constructing and organising everything from scratch.  

Each of these learning goals connects with my philosophy of teaching and my current stage in my professional journey, and it hence gives shape to this portfolio. Accordingly, some standards in this portfolio contain more entries and annotations than others, according to their relevance to my goals.
