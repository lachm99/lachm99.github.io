## Hi, I'm Lachie

I'm an early-career Computer Scientist and Software Dev.

I'm passionate about using my life to do good and honour God, and I'm
fascinated by technology. As a result, I'm excited by opportunities to use
tech in creative and positive ways; leveraging the skills I love using for the
good of others.  

I'm hoping to marry these twin passions throughout my career,
making serious and skilfull contributions to work which has an impact for good.

For now, checkout some of my other projects on [github](https://github.com/lachm99),
or learn a bit more about me at [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/lachm99).  

Don't hesitate to [get in touch!](../contact)
