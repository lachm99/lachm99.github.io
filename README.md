# lachm99.github.io

My personal website. Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Built upon [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll)[/minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and
[pages-themes](https://github.com/pages-themes)[/minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).

Currently very simple, mostly an about page. Hoping to extend further by adding Blog posts!
