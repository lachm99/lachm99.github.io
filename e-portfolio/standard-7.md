While Standard 7 describes crucial aspects of the teaching profession, it does not align as directly with my current learning goals as the other standards. Additionally, I have not yet had the opportunity to gather evidence specific to Standard 7 in the context of Stage 6 Mathematics, and therefore, this portfolio does not include entries dedicated primarily to this area.

As I progress from my training into full-time teaching, however, I recognise that this standard will require significant attention. In particular, I will need to focus on 7.3, as I have not yet engaged with the parents or carers of students in Stage 6 Mathematics. Building patterns and practices for navigating these relationships will be a key priority moving forward.
