<!-- WOOTUBE -->
{% include item-title.html title="Wootube" first=True %}

One of the best ways for an aspiring teacher to learn, is to observe an expert teacher (Marzano & Boogren, 2010). [Wootube](https://misterwootube.com/) is a multi-site repository of quality mathematics teaching resources, containing, among other things, numerous recordings of real lessons in real classrooms, taught by expert teacher Eddie Woo (Woo, 2020).

This resource is invaluable for meeting focus areas 2.1, 2.2, and 2.5, especially for early career teachers who are unsure how to present a new topic or structure a learning sequence. 

However, potential ethical concerns emerge due to the fact that Wootube’s videos are hosted on YouTube, a Google-owned media platform which has been the centre of countless ethical and moral disputes. YouTube has been criticised for variously allowing radicalising, extremist, pirated, disinformational, and explicit media to be distributed on their platform, as well as exacerbating the social media anxiety epidemic by promulgating influencer lifestyles among young people. 

Furthermore, YouTube is renowned for its pre- and mid-roll advertisements, promoting any number of products, services, or ideological campaigns. It must be asked whether any use of YouTube, especially before others, is tacitly promoting an unhealthy platform and its parent company. 

One mitigating factor for the use of Wootube is that all the videos are un-monetised, so no ads are displayed. Additionally, this is a resource which is primarily for teacher development outside of the classroom, so students needn’t be encouraged to use YouTube for themselves. Purely through the lens of enhancing teaching and learning, this resource is highly effective and ethically permissible, though this should be periodically reviewed as YouTube and its community guidelines continues to develop and change.

<!-- DESMOS -->

[Desmos](https://desmos.com/) began as a collection of various graphing and geometry calculators, but has since developed into an extensive suite of mathematics tools including interactive activities and teaching resources (Desmos Studio PBC, 2024). The suite meshes well with focus area 2.6, providing many strategies for meaningfully implementing ICT in lessons across the curriculum. 

The Desmos suite is best used as an aide for a skilled teacher, who thoughtfully selects visualisations, demonstrations, and activities which enrich the learning by helping students move to depth of understanding. Mathematics is, arguably, a discipline fundamentally about patterns and relationships, so visualisation tools can facilitate the transition from knowledge to understanding by providing a novel means of representation by which these patterns and relationships become recognisable and sensible (Gates, 2018).

One of the best ways to help students to depth of understanding in the sciences is a kind of discovery learning process, where students are encouraged along a journey which precipitates moments of realisation and insight (Kroeker, 1967; Shieh & Yu, 2016). Desmos is a great tool in this realm, since students can be set a task to investigate, for instance, a family of non-linear relationships, tweaking parameters and uncovering truths.

In personal experience, students who learn the transformations of a parabola by discovering the transformations themselves are much better at retaining that information correctly than those who first learnt the rules and then saw them applied.
