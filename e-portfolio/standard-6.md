A key component of my training experience has been the opportunity to observe expert teachers in Stage 6. I have benefitted immensely from observing experienced teachers in their craft, whether teaching standard mathematics, extension 2, or even IBDP mathematics courses. As Marzano & Boogren (2010) identify, observing expert teachers is a highly effective way for new teachers to grow. My own approach to teaching Stage 6 Mathematics has been most notably shaped through observation of my mentor teacher in mathematics advanced.

I have adopted and adapted many features present in my mentor's lessons, including explicit Learning Intentions and Success Criteria, embedded thinking routines, modelled working, and included visualisations. Many of these features have made Stage 6 teaching feel less intimidating, since I have observed an approach which I have seen succeed, and know what ingredients to include to make a lesson cohere.  

However, I am also careful to not expect too much of myself. Many teachers I have observed have reminded me that their lessons, notes, and resources are an accumulation of years spent teaching Stage 6 Mathematics. They direct me to focus my effort on content expertise and syllabus familiarisation, rather than spending too much time on developing polished slides, lesson notes, or activities. These will naturally accumulate as I continue to teach, but it would be unwise and unsustainable to expect to finish my first year of teaching with a full bank of highly polished lessons.  

With all of this in mind, my goal as I enter the profession is to become confident to teach the concepts in the syllabus, and comfortable to depend on resources and lessons prepared by others - focussing my efforts on those teaching, learning and assessment activities which will have the most impact.
