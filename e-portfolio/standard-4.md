Liljedahl (2016) explores how many learning environments are not actually conducive to quality thinking, and suggests a number of features which may help teachers transform their classrooms into learning environments which support thinking.  

The first of these is collaboration in visibly random groups. [Team Picker Wheel](https://pickerwheel.com/tools/random-team-generator/) is a web app designed to assign names from a list into random groups (Picker Wheel, 2024). There are various features which make this tool incredibly useful for a classroom teacher. Names can be imported directly, names can be excluded during randomisation, or distributed with regard for gender or other sub-groupings.

A tool such as this, which can be used in front of the class to achieve visibly random groups, makes a huge impact on the learning environment, fostering inclusivity and engagement (Liljedahl, 2016), and as such contributes to addressing the target areas of 4.1 and 4.2. It can also be set up once, and from that point relieve the teacher of any organisational effort each time groups must be assigned.

Secondly, Liljedahl (2016) advocates for the use of whiteboards to promote visible thinking and mathematical reasoning. Research indicates that the use of whiteboards is indeed highly effective for increasing the engagement and effectiveness of mathematical problem solving (Forrester et al., 2017; Megowan-Romanowicz, 2016). Additionally, the use of whiteboards specifically for problem solving rather than repetitive practise is particularly effective for establishing high expectations for thinking and not just technique.  

In my stage 6 classrooms, I have found that using vertical whiteboards for collaborative problem solving in a similar fashion to many university tutorials, has encouraged students to take greater responsibility for their mathematical reasoning and representation, as well as promoting higher levels of thinking. The use of whiteboards is especially effective when problems involve visual or graphical components, as students are free to sketch, draft, and reattempt problems without fear of preserving their errors. However, I have learned through setbacks that these problems must be carefully curated and reviewed - nothing frustrates student engagement as much as a problem that is "broken" or overly ambiguous.

It is necessary to acknowledge focus area 4.5, which has shaped the substance of this portfolio. While not referenced explicitly in each item, this focus area has informed the acquisition and appraisal of all the ICT tools included.
