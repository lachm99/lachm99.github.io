OneNote is a versatile free-form notepad and information organisation app (Microsoft.com, 2024). It is a fantastic tool for teachers, as it can be used both to structure lessons, and then deliver them interactively. 

OneNote pairs particularly well with mathematics, which requires written working, symbols, and diagrams, all much easier drawn than typed. Used together with Vivi, OneNote enables work to be modelled live on the board and preserved for students to review at their convenience.

OneNote is flexible, and can be effectively employed to address every focus areas of standard 3: 
- Each page may be headed with explicit learning intentions and success criteria, defining an appropriate level of challenge for the class (3.1),
- Lesson sequences can be grouped in notebooks and notebook sections, with links between pages (3.2),
- A lesson’s page may be segmented and annotated to indicate which learning strategy is to be used by the class, or to prompt the teacher to use an instructional strategy (3.3),
- Multi-media resources can be embedded in the page as interactive content frames and links (3.4),
- Various non-verbal means of communication are enabled: written instructions, diagrams, and other representations can all be depicted on the board (3.5),  
- A OneNote page can be annotated in real time or in retrospect to evaluate the teaching program and improve it for future use (3.6),  
- Parents can even access their child’s school notebook with their own account, viewing the taught content, the assigned work, and their child’s progress (3.7).

Vivi is a wireless screen-share app which is incredibly useful for teaching in a mathematics classroom, where problems can be displayed with a projector and worked in real time.

Vivi boasts many additional features to implement engaging lessons, including a countdown timer, a collaborative digital whiteboard, student split-screen, and video queues. As such, it aids in accomplishing focus areas 3.3 and 3.5, since it enables and aids various teaching strategies, and increases the number of available means for effective communication.

The use of Vivi in schools has one serious ethical liability: when a teacher shares their screen, they are exhibiting their device to the whole class. If they are not sufficiently organised or diligent, they may unintentionally display confidential or otherwise unsuitable material. 

This commonly occurs when teachers’ email notifications appear, but it can occur via a teacher displaying the roll while it is marked (containing private diagnoses or learning alerts), or accidentally sharing documents of a personal nature. In most instances the consequence is distraction, but the potential risk is extraordinary. Many students have a diagnosis which they are unaware of; exposing this diagnosis in class would be extremely damaging (Murray, 2006). Some emails contain information that would be inappropriate for students to read, and would constitute a serious privacy breach matter.

Nonetheless, I believe Vivi is worth using. Its value, provided risks can be mitigated, outweigh their likelihood and severity.
