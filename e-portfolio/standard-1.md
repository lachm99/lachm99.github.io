Student learning is wasted if new understanding does not find its way into long term memory. One of the most effective ways to
solidify learning is through retrieval practice (Roediger & Butler, 2011).  

A retrieval roulette, first created by [Adam Boxer](https://achemicalorthodoxy.co.uk/2017/05/04/the-retrieval-roulette/) (2017), enables teachers to collate a question bank over the entirety of a course, and automatically present a selection of both interleaved and recent retrieval questions for students to attempt each lesson.

The use of this kind of tool contributes to focus area 1.2, as it represents a knowledge of the way students gain and retain knowledge.

Roulettes like the above align with focus area 1.5, since the difficulty of some or all of the retrieval activities can be easily configured to increase complexity and challenge, or to provide students with options for self-differentiation.
